began in the 1st century after the birth of Jesus as a Judaic sect with Hellenistic influence, in the Roman province of \r\nJudaea. The disciples of Jesus spread their faith around the Eastern Mediterranean area, despite significant persecution. The \r\ninclusion of Gentiles led Christianity to slowly separate from Judaism (2nd century). Emperor Constantine I decriminalized \r\nChristianity in the Roman Empire by the Edict of Milan (313), later convening the Council of Nicaea (325) where Early Christianity \r\nwas consolidated into what would become the state religion of the Roman Empire

Considered an archetypal masterpiece of the \r\nItalian Renaissance, it has been described as \"the best known, the most visited, the most written about, the most sung about, \r\n[and] the most parodied work of art in the world\". The painting\u0027s novel qualities include the subject\u0027s enigmatic expression, \r\nmonumentality of the composition, the subtle modelling of forms, and the atmospheric illusionism.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Andrea\\stage\\codice\\RAGtest\\testrag\\target\\classes","file_name":"monalisa.pdf","index":"0"}}}},{"id":"f9be38c5-2a0b-419d-aaa4-875b7399a64f","embedding":{"vector":[-0.07464987,-0.06715299,0.019395292,-0.0012253529,-0.019965848,-0.04588362,-0.014673326,0.01898312,-0.032898393,-0.105229005,0.0067441976,-0.020242898,0.050986394,-6.713651E-4,-0.041695293,1.3634916E-4,0.014935778,0.028399045,0.05123688,0.07509179,0.055390466,-0.039837766,-0.01840475,0.04760748,0.058163054,0.071949944,0.01311762,-0.059867285,-0.013415531,0.050672017,-0.07144005,-0.014772536,-0.06510795,0.008361139,0.021071637,0.010123486,0.02551913,-0.051103093,0.11936954,-0.008616186,-0.08643746,-0.030753743,-0.01702949,-0.028137287,0.06452885,0.013946164,0.05645772,0.057951584,0.06618394,-0.039124694,-0.009640669,0.03406129,-0.010731485,-0.06881927,0.0031583752,-0.04665613,0.0105821965,-0.101857066,0.014513,0.07494866,-0.027169837,0.07432599,0.013223166,0.05710413,0.01238958,0.004866226,-0.050384887,-0.11359255,-0.019831823,-0.042389885,0.012498585,-0.03312623,0.03795069,-0.07245417,-0.008441356,0.036072273,0.05525728,0.036985707,-0.046024807,-0.03880982,0.047517482,-0.04482551,0.071394704,0.10827542,0.030336753,0.04969791,0.05760438,0.024960658,0.047184635,0.033755846,0.020885874,0.013926111,-0.12596528,0.034787405,0.01940728,-0.06869081,-0.06937827,0.05247437,-0.003759314,-0.004306408,-0.016969759,-0.023683546,0.06385909,0.010233609,0.033232488,0.047944922,0.026290227,0.061357804,-0.023492657,0.032936573,-0.056782164,-0.05132072,-0.0052734045,-0.023481522,-0.073898256,0.064393625,-0.037351962,-0.118506126,-0.02893834,-0.04853117,-0.014205601,-0.069589965,-0.029628517,-0.0032812597,-0.1010624,-0.0065143057,3.8979363E-4,-1.8131833E-33,-0.018174997,-0.003046588,0.045643467,-0.018615117,-0.023159409,0.082896695,-0.02756479,-0.02029153,-0.0032806944,-0.0089669,0.047522455,-0.018010948,-0.11151125,0.07981688,-0.009039859,0.0885602,0.114806674,-0.08394849,0.019576458,-0.0247545,0.030629223,-0.010060961,-0.043727152,0.010581551,0.005392672,0.11028129,-0.03886826,0.044172008,-0.13667119,0.046354923,-0.020413378,-0.045484614,0.042946544,0.007822071,-0.040579103,-0.015888616,0.0070911474,-0.034437604,0.022993322,0.12012069,-0.016476396,-0.025237724,-0.007908163,0.048264164,-0.013008175,0.009780442,0.04399756,0.023536079,-0.023131307,0.029790763,0.0035847453,0.04216248,-0.13027234,-0.015620863,0.007882445,-0.0040959674,-0.017166393,-0.008344182,0.010487309,-0.056330398,0.019820455,0.050475676,0.0052964687,0.08889125,0.01934388,0.1157586,-0.009071205,0.07470979,-0.061265945,0.030761385,-0.092752546,4.9816466E-5,0.04402269,-0.04278484,0.03066504,0.015186876,0.032515958,-0.02405422,-5.520911E-4,0.0014503048,0.024617286,-0.05124229,0.015442226,0.018586287,-0.020277284,0.07583583,0.017148176,0.07203536,-0.034852132,0.011834407,0.003691199,-0.026589444,6.2528794E-4,0.028264634,-0.06301682,-1.662845E-33,0.016639464,-0.009122427,0.039931398,-0.07035103,-0.056450482,-0.08823243,-0.045538545,0.0342169,0.038974367,0.02877808,-0.030174628,-0.056897633,2.7822272E-4,0.062765375,-0.0044429717,0.05127508,-0.048547376,-0.0865118,-0.080618866,0.0048170504,0.034225985,0.07946164,-0.017137049,-0.003086103,-0.12769459,0.059084393,-0.058462787,-0.06089602,-0.012067046,-0.021194847,-0.09197468,-0.10969448,0.05679378,-0.036300212,0.05041675,0.016086297,0.06711084,-0.032128826,0.07669659,0.06762229,-0.04256379,-0.00747912,0.008408362,9.624465E-5,0.023502704,0.0024121492,0.03025391,-0.04208782,0.0753404,0.014974953,-0.020855507,-0.026366487,0.064097054,-0.0019943637,-0.035889637,-0.03848909,0.041569587,0.03546331,0.019442497,0.06831648,-0.029898856,0.027336296,-0.040599227,0.0010612874,-0.004123346,0.0011506327,-0.06747521,0.0015005067,0.0031714877,-0.02030089,-0.0023519523,0.0037460737,-0.05073813,0.051785693,0.027363602,0.009855118,0.022345873,0.014846169,0.07298845,0.0203252,-0.009863558,-0.010118008,0.0040881853,-0.025780316,-0.006843167,-0.02497119,-0.0785374,-0.08705664,0.034337725,-0.13246539,0.043087818,0.040085416,0.05802926,-0.10888397,0.01049123,-3.7701632E-8,0.0012101309,0.10323954,0.05596187,-0.06423942,0.05490878,-0.07408053,0.034476526,0.06287569,0.023957299,-0.03566984,-0.05023615,0.037791986,-0.020289341,-0.07242679,-0.014878167,-0.055967495,0.03567328,-0.1058264,0.062071048,-0.0071485336,0.026997007,-0.114324115,0.07487454,-0.07818645,-0.04668562,-0.077610895,0.03954929,-0.017536262,-0.1570672,0.07444321,-0.07733801,-0.03703161,-0.022277454,-0.029049179,0.0220463,-0.0072240853,-0.06003691,-0.06064416,-0.08970306,-0.005470595,0.09662126,0.03284505,-0.017580986,0.023693943,0.08364191,0.10262514,0.11762249,-0.08440423,0.05937509,0.0680676,-0.0051234886,5.171527E-4,0.04232444,-0.0073278565,-0.0297362,-0.021784686,0.0766386,0.044112593,0.063305534,0.0331553,0.005133753,0.011931382,-0.0029841384,-0.046103746]},"embedded":{"text":"The painting has been traditionally considered to depict the Italian noblewoman Lisa del Giocondo. It is painted in oil on a white \r\nLombardy poplar panel. Leonardo never gave the painting to the Giocondo family. It was believed to have been painted between \r\n1503 and 1506; however, Leonardo may have continued working on it as late as 1517. King Francis I of France acquired the Mona \r\nLisa after Leonardo\u0027s death in 1519, and it is now the property of the French Republic. It has normally been on display at the \r\nLouvre in Paris since

claims to be among the oldest cities in northern Italy. According to a tradition dated at least to the time of Virgil\u0027s Aeneid \r\nand to Livy\u0027s Ab Urbe Condita, Padua was founded around 1183 BC by the Trojan prince Antenor. Nevertheless, archeological \r\nremains confirm an early date for the foundation of the center of the town to between the 11th and 10th centuries B.C.\n\nSince local government political reorganization in 1993, Padua has been governed by the City Council of Padua. Voters elect \r\ndirectly 33 councilors and the Mayor of Padua every five years. The current Mayor of Padua is Sergio Giordani (independent, \r\nsupported by the PD), elected on 26 June
